                <h1>Death in the sickroom</h1><h3>By&nbsp;Tom</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="text ">
                    The picture shows what we can assume to be the artist鈥檚 family grouped around his sister Sophie,
                    who died in 1877. She is sitting in a chair with her back to us. To the right stands an aunt, Kar
                    en Bj酶lstad, who moved in with the family to take care of the children and the household after
                    the mother died of tuberculosis in 1868. In the background stands the father, the doctor Christian
                    Munch, with his hands clasped as if in prayer. Near the centre of the picture is a male figure, pro
                    bably Edvard, in quarter-face. Sister Laura is sitting in the foreground with her hands in her lap,
                    while the third sister, Inger, stands staring straight at us. The male figure to the left is generally
                    identified as Edvard鈥檚 younger brother Andreas. In Death in the SickRoom there is no physical contact
                    between the people, except for the hand that aunt Karen has laid on the back of the chair in which the
                    invalid sits.</p>
